\chapter*{Acknowledgements}\label{ch:Agradecimientos}
It has been a very intense course, which I am bringing to a close with this work. First of all, I would like to thank the teachers of the master's degree for their work, 
which despite the precipitous circumstances in which the course has developed, we have managed to survive, to get through it, and above all to learn a lot. I would also 
like to thank Serena and Miguel √Ångel for their willingness to embark on this project and for guiding both Jordi and myself in its development. Of course also to Jordi, 
for making work not just work, for those meetings that almost always took longer than expected, and for his patience, it is a pleasure to work with people who make everything easier. 
Finally, thanks to my friends and family for their support, for putting up with my constant complaints about this work and for always being there.
