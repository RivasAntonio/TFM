The main objectives of this Master's thesis are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item To understand what Hawkes processes are, where we can find them, how to generate them computationally and relate them with neuroscience.
    \item To understand the importance of time binning and reproduce the results of the original paper 
    \cite{notarmuzi2021percolation} and compare them with the results obtained in this work.
    \item Â¿Criticality?
    \item To study the behaviour of a self-exciting process with $n=2$ and compare it with the case $n=1$. 
    \item To study the behaviour of an inhibitory and excitatory neuron coupled.
\end{itemize}
