\chapter{Objectives} \label{ch:objectives}

The main objectives of this Master's thesis are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item To understand the basics of criticality and its appearance in living systems, particularly in the brain. 
    \item To understand what Hawkes processes are, where we can find them, how to generate them computationally and relate them with neuroscience.
    \item To understand the importance of time binning and reproduce the results of the original paper.
    \cite{notarmuzi2021percolation} and compare them with the results obtained in this work.
    \item To study the behaviour of a supercritical self-exciting process and compare it with the results from a critical process. 
    \item To study how an excitatory and inhibitory coupled Hawkes process behave.
\end{itemize}
