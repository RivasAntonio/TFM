\chapter{Introduction}



Hawkes processes are a class of point processes that are widely used in the modeling of self-exciting events. They have been applied to a variety of fields, such as seismology, 
neuroscience, finance, and social networks. The main feature of Hawkes processes is that the intensity or rate of the process is not constant, but depends on the history of the process itself.
